Routing:
It supports file/page based routing.
Routing are associated with the file name  defined in pages folder

index.tsx >> / (Root route)
about.tsx >> /about (About page route)


Dynamic Routes:

A folder with route name should be created for implementing Nested Routing
1. To render /products/:productId a product folder should be created and then [productId].tsx should be created inside that folder
2. Before matching dynamic route it will look for the exact file name with path. If it doesn't match then it will match for dynamic route path
   Ex: /products/mobile with match pages/products/mobile.tsx folder whereas /products/laptop will match pages/products/[productId].tsx

Catch All routes:
In order to cache all routes starts with pathname/*/*.....   [...params.tsx] can be created inside the pathname folder
Ex: pages/docs/[...params].tsx will match any routes starts with /docs****. It can be useful for SEO

Navigating Routes:
1. Link can be used to navigate routes from one page to another
2. replace property can be used to replace the current page with another one
3. router.push can be used to route programmatically


Custom 404 Page:
Define 404.tsx in root of the pages to use a custom 404 page
